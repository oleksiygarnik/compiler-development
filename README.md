# Compiler

## Overview

During the development of this compiler project, the following milestones were achieved:

1. **Grammar Design**  
   Developed the grammar for the specified programming language.

2. **Compiler Structure**  
   Defined the structure of the compiler.

3. **Functional Blocks**  
   Described and implemented the core functional blocks of the compiler.

4. **User Interface**  
   Designed and implemented an intuitive graphical user interface.

5. **Testing**  
   Tested the compiler by comparing the results of a test program with a semantically similar program in the object-oriented programming language C#.

## Components

The compiler includes the following key components:

1. **Lexical Analyzer**  
   Analyzes the source code and extracts tokens.

2. **Syntax Analyzer**  
   Processes tokens to construct a syntax tree and ensure adherence to syntax rules.

3. **Intermediate Representation**  
   Builds an intermediate form of the programâ€”Polish Notation (PN).

4. **Execution of PN**  
   Executes the Polish Notation code.

The programming language supports assignment operators, input and output operations with a flexible structure, as well as conditional and looping operators designed for specific tasks.
